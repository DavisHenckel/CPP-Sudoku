## CPP-Sudoku
Copy of my PS-Sudoku repository but Written in C++ to compare efficiency and refresh my C++ skills.

I built this project with a sudoku class and fed it the unique solution that took 3.5+ hours in PowerShell. With this C++ implementation the same solution solves in under 10 seconds on the same processor!  
  
I also took the opportunity to build out a Sudoku class to refresh skills with C++ class building.  
  
This project was built with QT creator and uses QMake.
